simple website that calculates the pricing of various items in ethereum.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

as chronically online crypto users, we often lose sight of how much money we are handling on a day-to-day basis.

it seems a lot more expensive to buy $50 in doordash than to ape a couple ethereum in some random coin.

built w/ a single js script that calls a crypto pricing website to get current price of eth.
